 Getting in touch
==================

You can get in touch with the Thetis development team in a number of
ways, for help, feature requests, bugs, or just to say hello.

Github
======

The best place to submit bug reports or feature requests is on the
`github project page <https://github.com/thetisproject/thetis>`__.

Slack
=====

Day-to-day development discussion takes place in the ``#thetis`` room
on Firedrake's `slack channel <https://firedrakeproject.slack.com>`__.
You are welcome to join, but must request an invite to join the
channel, which you can do by `visiting this page
<https://firedrakeproject.herokuapp.com/>`__.

The `slack IRC gateway
<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP>`__
is enabled for this channel, so you can connect via IRC if you wish
after signing up.
